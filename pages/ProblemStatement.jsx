          <h2>🔥 Alactic AGI Integrated Problems</h2>
          <p>
            Alactic AGI integrated problems require structured grounding of unstructured data
            for domain-specific intelligence systems. These problems evaluate your ability to
            design scalable AI architectures that convert raw, unstructured data into reliable,
            context-aware intelligence pipelines.
